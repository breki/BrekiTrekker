- warning when you're very near the starting point for some time
    - how to detect this?
        - it should only work after some minimum distance has been covered
        - average distance in last X seconds?

- display ETA
    - recalculate it only every 10 seconds to save battery

- warning when you're stationary for some time
    - but then we need support for pausing the activity

- allow the user to store the elevation for the starting location so the app
    can next time warn the user that they have to calibrate the elevation

- add support for yoga activity?

- show calories

- add license file

- indicate when the GPS is ready
	- can we handle "GPS is ready" event?
	- show GPS icon

- icon for the app

- can we calibrate the altitude?

    - it either has to be calculated or fetched from the internet

- use key handlers to handle the buttons so we can implement short/long presses
- what to do with up, down buttons?

- detect when you're near the starting point and vibrate
