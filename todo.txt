- temperature text color should be white

- stop any battery-hungry activity once the activity has been saved

- add license file

- should we use maxHeartRate from ActivityInfo?

- ascent is not correctly calculated, for some reason (start at +10 right at the start) 
    - that's because we start recording the altitude at the initial screen and 
        I calibrated the altitude after that

- use elapsedTime instead of using a custom timer

- indicate when the GPS is ready
	- can we handle "GPS is ready" event?
	- show GPS icon

- icon for the app

- can we calibrate the altitude?

- display the next sunset/sunrise time
    - it either has to be calculated or fetched from the internet

- show info about when the battery will run out

- add support for pausing
- handle onStop() to persist application data 
    (https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/core-topics/application-and-system-modules/)
- use key handlers to handle the buttons so we can implement short/long presses
- what to do with up, down buttons?

- detect when you're near the starting point and vibrate
